# COVID-19 Vaccine Analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing COVID-19 vaccine data. The analysis includes evaluating vaccine effectiveness, monitoring safety, identifying at-risk populations, and optimizing vaccination strategies. Below are instructions on how to run the code and any dependencies required.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x: The code is written in Python. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Jupyter Notebook (optional): Some parts of the analysis might be presented in Jupyter Notebook format. You can install Jupyter Notebook using `pip`:
  ```
  pip install notebook
  ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Abinav37/DAC_Phase5.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd covid-vaccine-analysis
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages using `pip`:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   If the analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`), you can open it using the following command:
   ```
   jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
   ```
   Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code cells.

2. **Run Python Scripts**:
   If the analysis is provided as Python scripts (`.py` files), you can run them using the Python interpreter:
   ```
   python analysis.py
   ```
   

## Data Source

The analysis uses COVID-19 vaccine data from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress]. Make sure to download the latest dataset and place it in the `data` directory before running the code.

## Folder Structure

- **data**: This directory contains the raw data files used for the analysis.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter Notebook files for interactive analysis (if applicable).
- **scripts**: Python scripts containing the analysis code.
